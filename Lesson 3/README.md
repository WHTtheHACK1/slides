Hear Me Code Lesson 3
======

**What you'll learn:** 
* Reading data from a text file
* Reading data from a spreadsheet
* Why dictionaries are useful for storing information in a structured way

**Just a few practical examples:**
* Reading data from a text file and turning it into a string
* Reading data from a text file and turning it into a list
* Reading data from a spreadsheet and looping over its contents to use the data
* Using dictionaries to store information in a structure like a phonebook

**Examples in real projects:**
* Open a text file containing a list of schools: [Used in https://shannonvturner.com/seriously](https://github.com/shannonturner/seriously/blob/e157c59c601ad66c8a5a6e1c3562377552a858ff/geocode.py#L6)
* Build a dictionary with data about a school to turn it into GeoJSON used for mapping: [Used in https://shannonvturner.com/seriously](https://github.com/shannonturner/seriously/blob/e157c59c601ad66c8a5a6e1c3562377552a858ff/geocode.py#L19)
* Ensure that a user-created Metro Map is a valid map (it has stations and rail lines) so that it can be saved and rebuilt: [Used in https://metromapmaker.com](https://github.com/shannonturner/metro-map-maker/blob/881571c7ef9edc0818686f5a6bbdbeba8e8c8a1d/metro_map_saver/map_saver/validator.py#L81)
* If this movie's rating is disputed, display a caveat for the rating. Otherwise, don't edit the rating: [Used in https://shannonvturner.com/bechdel](https://github.com/shannonturner/bechdel/blob/3178c6f9132fca77cb068facb07a13bd3f4ce234/apps/bechdel/views.py#L187)
